# Firefly - A learning project
Go to the [main branch](https://github.com/hotaru08/FireflyEngine.git) 
for latest changes.

Firefly Project is a project directed in learning and implementing systems that 
are necessary for game engine development, as a learning project to understand
better how to implement different systems in game engines.

In addition, it acts as a project to improve in programming in C++ as well as 
to explore C++20 functionalities.

Systems that I have dwelled into in the past were:
- Win32 (basic knowledge)
- Win32 custom inputs (includes basic object picking via opengl method)
- Physics and Collision
- Editor (mainly for linking graphics to imgui)
- Very basic 2D graphics (non-optimised)

Other skills:
- C# scripting for game scripting
- Game Level and System Design
